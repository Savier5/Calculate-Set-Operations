# Calculating Set Operations

This project was developed for my Discrete Structures class, I created a program that takes two sets of integers as input from the user and performs six set operations: union, intersection, difference, complement, symmetric difference, and Cartesian product. The universal set consists of integers from 1 to 100. My program dynamically processes any valid integer input within this range and generates the correct output based on the user's input, rather than being hard-coded for specific cases.

## Output:
